Install
-------

To install for development, clone the repo and use branch ``v2``:

.. code-block:: bash

    git -b v2 clone git@github.com:mila-iqia/milabench.git
    cd milabench
    # <Activate virtual environment>
    # Install in editable mode
    pip install -e .

This will install two commands, ``milabench`` and ``voir``.
